IMPORTANT: These waste patterns have never been disclosed before because no other
technology can address them. Unity's revolutionary MPTS (Maximum Power Transfer Solution)
is the only existing technology that can significantly reduce this waste by up to 95%.

Unity leverages reactive energy as a catalyst to balance electrical imbalances
without creating net energy loss - fundamentally different from other approaches
that add parasitic loads to the system.

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Focus on improving power factor for transformers with PF < 0.85
2. Consider load balancing between underutilized and overutilized transformers
3. Implement power factor correction to reduce reactive power waste
4. Monitor and optimize cooling systems for high-waste transformers
